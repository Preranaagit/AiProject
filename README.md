# AiProject
This project presents a complete AI pipeline for skin cancer detection using self-supervised learning with DINO and Vision Transformers (ViT). The notebook includes preprocessing steps such as image resizing and normalization, model training using a transformer-based architecture, and evaluation through accuracy metrics and confusion matrix analysis. Designed to support early diagnosis and aligned with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), this project demonstrates how modern deep learning methods can effectively classify dermatoscopic images. To run the project, install dependencies like PyTorch, OpenCV, and scikit-learn, then execute the notebook sequentially in Jupyter or Colab with a compatible dataset such as HAM10000.We used Colab Pro version to maintain consistent runtime and avoid crashes.
